# OSS_Mini_Project / 21600153 / Junhee Kim / Bookstore management system

It is a program that makes it easy to access and handle information on books that exist in bookstore.
The program stores information on books that exist in bookstore in the form of a data set and has functions that deal with this data.
This program allows you to add or modify data and delete it.
It is also possible to store information in other data files, when it is possible to save it in a report format.
Finally, the program can help you easily find information about your saved books or sort them out according to specified conditions.
